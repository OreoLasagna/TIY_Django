Do this in a standalone terminal. NOT IN VS CODE

Creating Virtual Environment:
py -m venv ll_env


Activating Virtual Environment: -After you've navigated to the proper folder directory-
ll_env\Scripts\activate

When it works you should see a little (ll_env) to the side of the Command Prompt active line


After creating your virtual environment for the first time you have to install Django
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install django


Thennnnnn you need to create the project in Django. The extra period at the end is important it makes a manage.py file at the folder level
django-admin startproject (PROJECT NAME GOES HERE - EX: ll_project) .



Deactivating the Virtual Environment:
deactivate


Viewing the Project and turning it out after you've enabled the virtual environment:
py manage.py runserver

Local Host is here - http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Slap that into your URL of a browser of your choice

>Also. Good idea to have one terminal in the background just have the Project running.
>Then make new terminals to do everything else


Turning off the Project:
Ctrl + C


Creating a new app:
py manage.py startapp learning_logs


Creating/Modifying the Database: -Remember the directory where you have direct access to manage.py-
py manage.py migrate



Updating a Database to include a specific app:
py manage.py makemigrations learning_logs

Here we are saying look at the learning_logs folder and grab any changes stuffed into models 
Then to publish it to the database you then run the py manage.py migrate call again to commit it to the DB

PLEASE NOTE. WHEN YOURE DOING ANYTHING WITH THE DB REMEMBER TO RUN THIS FOR THE APP YOU CREATED.
NOT THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT OR DJANGO OR WHATEVER.



Creating a super/admin user:
py manage.py createsuperuser

You'll be prompted to add a Username. And you HAVE to add a password.
For this we named our username 'll_admin'
PW is Test123!

What's confusing is that when you enter in the PW in the terminal it will not actually show it as you type it out



Accessing the Admin Site:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

ll_admin/Test123!



Creating a shell - Page 386:
py manage.py shell

To exit a shell session hit CTRL + Z then Enter

Then when we want to test something in the shell...
from learing_logs.models import Topic
Topic.objects.all()
